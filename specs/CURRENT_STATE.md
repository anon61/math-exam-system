## 📅 Status: Phase 3.5 (Data Population)
**Goal:** Create a consistent "Golden Dataset" for testing and development.

### 🏗️ Active Tasks (Todo)
- [ ] **Generate Mock Data**: Create 8 YAML files in `data/` with linked Real Analysis content.
- [ ] **Create `tests/test_cli_e2e.py`**: Now that data exists, build the automated test.
