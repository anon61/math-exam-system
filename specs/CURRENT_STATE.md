# Project State Log

## ✅ Completed: Phase 3.6 (Stress Testing)
- [x] **Passed Stress Test**: Simulated 50+ operations. Verified 6.75 ops/sec performance.
- [x] **Integrity Confirmed**: The system successfully blocked deletion of linked nodes under load.

## 📅 Status: Phase 4 (Content Integration)
**Goal:** Bridge the gap between the Python Database and VS Code so I can write Typst faster.

### 🏗️ Active Tasks (Todo)
- [ ] **Create `scripts/generate_snippets.py`**: A script that reads the database and generates VS Code autocompletions.
    - *Why:* So I can type `def` and see "Limit of a sequence" instead of memorizing IDs.
- [ ] **Configure VS Code**: Ensure the `.vscode/typst.code-snippets` file is loaded.
- [ ] **First Real Worksheet**: Create a sample Typst file using the new system.

### 🛑 Current Blockers
- None.
