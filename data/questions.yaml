    - type: claim
      title: "Well-Defined"
      content: "The map $psi$ does not depend on the choice of representative $g$."
      proof: "Suppose $g_1 K = g_2 K$. Then $g_2^(-1) g_1 in K = ker(phi)$. Thus $phi(g_2^(-1) g_1) = e_H$, which implies $phi(g_1) = phi(g_2)$. So $psi(g_1 K) = psi(g_2 K)$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Homomorphism"
      content: "$psi$ is a homomorphism."
      proof: "$psi((x K)(y K)) = psi(x y K) = phi(x y) = phi(x)phi(y) = psi(x K)psi(y K)$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Bijectivity"
      content: "$psi$ is both injective and surjective."
      proof: |
        1. Surjective: Since $phi$ is surjective, for any $h in H$, exists $g$ such that $phi(g)=h$. Thus $psi(g K)=h$.
        2. Injective: $psi(g K) = e_H => phi(g) = e_H => g in K => g K = K$ (the identity in $G/K$).

    - type: conclusion
      title: "Isomorphism"
