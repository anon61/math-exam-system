  lecturer: "Prof. Lebesque"
  topic: "Measure Theory"
  given: |
    Let $(X, M, mu)$ be a measure space.
    Let $f_n -> f$ pointwise a.e. and $|f_n| <= g in L^1$.
  to_prove: |
    $ lim_(n->infinity) integral f_n d mu = integral f d mu $
  tools: "Fatou's Lemma, Dominated Convergence"
  common_mistakes: "Forgetting non-negativity check."
  hint: |

  answer_steps:
    - type: setup
      title: "Triangle Ineq. Bound"
      content: "Since $|f_n| <= g$ and $g in L^1$, by the triangle inequality, we have $|f_n - f| <= |f_n| + |f| <= 2g$."
    
    - type: claim
      title: "Construct Non-Negative"
      content: "The sequence $h_n = 2g - |f_n - f|$ is non-negative."
      proof: "Since $|f_n - f| <= 2g$, it follows that $2g - |f_n - f| >= 0$. Thus Fatou's Lemma applies to $h_n$."

    - type: calculation
      title: "Apply Fatou's Lemma"
      content: |
        $ integral 2g <= lim inf integral (2g - |f_n - f|) $
        $ integral 2g <= integral 2g - lim sup integral |f_n - f| $

    - type: step
      title: "Simplification"
      content: "Subtracting the finite integral $integral 2g$ from both sides (valid since $g in L^1$):"
    
    - type: conclusion
      title: "Final Result"
      content: |
        $ 0 <= - lim sup integral |f_n - f| => lim sup integral |f_n - f| <= 0 $
        Since the integral of absolute value is non-negative, the limit is 0. Q.E.D.

  year: 2023
  lecturer: "Dr. Cauchy"
  topic: "Real Analysis"
  given: |
    Prove the limit of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ as $x -> 1$.
  to_prove: |
    $ lim_(x->1) (2x+3) = 5 $
  tools: "Epsilon-Delta Definition"
  common_mistakes: "Backwards dependency."
  hint: |
    Start with $|f(x) - 5| < epsilon$.
  
  answer_steps:
    - type: setup
      title: "Definitions"
      content: "Let $epsilon > 0$. We must find $delta > 0$ such that $0 < |x - 1| < delta => |f(x) - 5| < epsilon$."
    
    - type: calculation
      title: "Factorization"
      content: |
        $ |(2x + 3) - 5| = |2x - 2| = 2|x - 1| $
    
    - type: step
      title: "Requirement"
      content: "We want this quantity to be less than $epsilon$. Thus we need $2|x - 1| < epsilon$, or $|x - 1| < epsilon / 2$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Choose Delta"
      content: "Choose $delta = epsilon / 2$."
      proof: "This choice directly satisfies the inequality derived above."

    - type: conclusion
      title: "Verification"
      content: "If $|x - 1| < delta$, then $|f(x) - 5| = 2|x - 1| < 2(epsilon/2) = epsilon$. Q.E.D."

  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Prof. Noether"
  topic: "Abstract Algebra"
  given: |
    Let $phi: G -> H$ be a surjective homomorphism with kernel $K$.
  to_prove: |
    $ G / K iso H $
  tools: "First Isomorphism Theorem"
  common_mistakes: "Well-definedness."
  hint: |
    Define $psi: G/K -> H$.
  
  answer_steps:
    - type: setup
      title: "Define Map"
      content: "Define the map $psi: G/K -> H$ by $psi(g K) = phi(g)$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Well-Defined"
      content: "The map $psi$ does not depend on the choice of representative $g$."
      proof: "Suppose $g_1 K = g_2 K$. Then $g_2^(-1) g_1 in K = ker(phi)$. Thus $phi(g_2^(-1) g_1) = e_H$, which implies $phi(g_1) = phi(g_2)$. So $psi(g_1 K) = psi(g_2 K)$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Homomorphism"
      content: "$psi$ is a homomorphism."
      proof: "$psi((x K)(y K)) = psi(x y K) = phi(x y) = phi(x)phi(y) = psi(x K)psi(y K)$."

    - type: claim
      title: "Bijectivity"
      content: "$psi$ is both injective and surjective."
      proof: |
        1. Surjective: Since $phi$ is surjective, for any $h in H$, exists $g$ such that $phi(g)=h$. Thus $psi(g K)=h$.
        2. Injective: $psi(g K) = e_H => phi(g) = e_H => g in K => g K = K$ (the identity in $G/K$).

    - type: conclusion
      title: "Isomorphism"
      content: "Since $psi$ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism. $G/K iso H$."
