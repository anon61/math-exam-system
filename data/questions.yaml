  topic: "Calculus"
  technique: "Implicit Differentiation"
  # TEST: Using the custom #ddx macro defined in utils.typ
  body: |
    Given the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$, find #ddx($y$).
    
    *Instructions:*
    - Treat $y$ as a function of $x$.
    - Isolate $y'$.
  hint: |
    Remember that #ddx($y^2$) is $2y y'$.
