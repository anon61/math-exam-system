  given: |
    Let $(X, M, mu)$ be a measure space.
    Let $f_n: X -&gt; [0, infinity]$ be a sequence of measurable functions such that $f_n -&gt; f$ pointwise almost everywhere.
    Assume there exists $g in L^1(mu)$ such that $|f_n| &lt;= g$ for all $n$.
  to_prove: |
    $lim_(n-&gt;infinity) integral_X f_n d mu = integral_X f d mu$

  lecturer: "Dr. Cauchy"
  topic: "Real Analysis"
  technique: "Epsilon of Room"
  given: |
    Let $K subset RR^n$ be a compact set and $U supset K$ be an open set.
  to_prove: |
    There exists a $delta &gt; 0$ such that for all $x in K$, the ball $B(x, delta) subset U$.
  hint: |
