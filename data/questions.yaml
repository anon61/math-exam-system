- id: "calc-001"
  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Prof. Integra"
  topic: "Calculus"
  technique: "Differentiation"
  body: |
    Calculate the derivative of the function $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5$.
    Use the power rule, which states #ddx($x^n$) $= n x^(n-1)$.
  hint: |
    #hint-box[
      Remember to apply the power rule to each term of the polynomial separately.

- id: "alg-001"
  year: 2023
  lecturer: "Dr. Matrix"
  topic: "Algebra"
  technique: "Linear Equations"
  body: |
    Solve the following system of linear equations:
    $ 2x + y = 5 $
    $ x - 3y = -1 $
  hint: |
    #hint-box[
      You can use either substitution or elimination. For substitution, solve one equation for `x` or `y` and plug it into the other.

- id: "logic-001"
  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Prof. Boole"
  topic: "Logic"
  technique: "Truth Tables"
  body: |
    Construct a truth table for the logical expression $(P and Q)$ => $R$.

    #img("truth-table-template.svg")
  hint: |
    #hint-box[
      Your table should have columns for $P$, $Q$, $R$, $P and Q$, and finally the full expression. There will be $2^3 = 8$ rows.
