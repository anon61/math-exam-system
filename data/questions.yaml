  lecturer: "Prof. Lebesque"
  topic: "Measure Theory"
  given: |
    Let $(X, M, mu)$ be a measure space.
    Let $f_n -> f$ pointwise a.e. and $|f_n| <= g in L^1$.
  to_prove: |
    $ lim_(n->infinity) integral f_n d mu = integral f d mu $
  tools: "Fatou's Lemma, Dominated Convergence"
  common_mistakes: "Forgetting to check if the measure is finite or functions are non-negative."
  hint: |
    Apply Fatou's Lemma to the non-negative sequence $g - |f_n - f|$.
  answer: |
    Since $|f_n| <= g$ and $g in L^1$, we have $|f_n - f| <= 2g$.
    Define $h_n = 2g - |f_n - f|$. Note $h_n >= 0$.
    By Fatou's Lemma:
    $ integral lim inf h_n <= lim inf integral h_n $
    Since $f_n -> f$, $h_n -> 2g$. Thus $integral 2g <= lim inf integral (2g - |f_n - f|)$.
    Subtracting the finite integral of $2g$ yields the result.

  lecturer: "Dr. Cauchy"
  topic: "Real Analysis"
  given: |
    Prove the limit of the function $f(x) = 2x + 3$ as $x -> 1$.
  to_prove: |
    $ lim_(x->1) (2x+3) = 5 $
  tools: "Epsilon-Delta Definition, Triangle Inequality"
  common_mistakes: "Expressing $delta$ in terms of $epsilon$ (finding the dependency backwards)."
  hint: |
    Start with $|f(x) - 5| < epsilon$ and simplify to find a relationship with $|x-1|$.
  answer: |
    Let $epsilon > 0$. We seek $delta > 0$ such that $0 < |x - 1| < delta => |(2x+3) - 5| < epsilon$.
    Simplifying the target: $|2x - 2| < epsilon => 2|x - 1| < epsilon => |x - 1| < epsilon / 2$.
    Choose $delta = epsilon / 2$.
    Then if $|x - 1| < delta$, we have $|f(x) - 5| = 2|x - 1| < 2(epsilon / 2) = epsilon$. Q.E.D.

  lecturer: "Prof. Noether"
  topic: "Abstract Algebra"
  given: |
    Let $phi: G -> H$ be a surjective homomorphism with kernel $K$.
  to_prove: |
    $ G / K iso H $
  tools: "First Isomorphism Theorem"
  common_mistakes: "Failing to show the map is well-defined (independent of representative)."
  hint: |
    Define a map $psi: G/K -> H$ by $psi(g K) = phi(g)$.
  answer: |
    Define $psi: G/K -> H$ by $psi(g K) = phi(g)$.
    1. Well-defined: If $g K = g' K$, then $g^(-1)g' in K = ker(phi)$, so $phi(g) = phi(g')$.
    2. Homomorphism: Follows from $phi$ being a homomorphism.
    3. Surjective: Since $phi$ is surjective.
    4. Injective: $psi(g K) = e_H => phi(g) = e_H => g in K => g K = K$.
    Thus $psi$ is an isomorphism.
