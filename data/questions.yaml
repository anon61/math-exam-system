  given: |
    Let $(X, M, mu)$ be a measure space.
    Let $f_n: X -> [0, infinity]$ be a sequence of measurable functions such that $f_n -> f$ pointwise almost everywhere.
    Assume there exists $g in L^1(mu)$ such that $|f_n| <= g$ for all $n$.
  to_prove: |
    $lim_(n->infinity) integral_X f_n d mu = integral_X f d mu$
