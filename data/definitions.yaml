- id: def-bounded
  term: Bounded Sequence
  content: A sequence is bounded if there exists a real number M such that |x_n| <=
    M for all n.
- id: def-cauchy
  term: Cauchy Sequence
  content: A sequence where the terms become arbitrarily close to each other as the
    sequence progresses.
- id: def-seq-limit
  term: Limit of a sequence
  content: A sequence x_n converges to L if for every epsilon > 0 there exists N such
    that |x_n - L| < epsilon for all n > N.
