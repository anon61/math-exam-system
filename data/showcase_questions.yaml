- id: "SHOWCASE-001"
  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Dr. Euclid"
  topic: "Geometry"
  technique: "Triangle Congruence"
  given: |
    In the figure below, we are given that $A B tilde B C$ and $A D = C D$.
    #figure(
      rect(width: 6cm, height: 4cm, stroke: 1pt),
      caption: [A diagram of the geometric setup.]
    )
  to_prove: |
    Show that triangle $A B D$ is congruent to triangle $C B D$.
    $Delta A B D tilde.equiv Delta C B D$
  hint: |
    #hint-box[Consider the properties of an isosceles triangle and shared sides. Which congruence theorem applies here (SSS, SAS, ASA)?]

- id: "SHOWCASE-002"
  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Prof. Newton"
  topic: "Calculus"
  technique: "Derivatives"
  given: |
    Use the rules of differentiation to find the derivative of the function below.
    $ f(x) = (x^2 + 1) / (sin x) $
  to_prove: |
    Find #ddx($f(x)$).
  hint: |
    You will need to use the *Quotient Rule*. Recall that for $f(x) = u/v$, the derivative is $f'(x) = (u'v - u v') / v^2$.

- id: "SHOWCASE-003"
  year: 2023
  lecturer: "Prof. Gauss"
  topic: "Number Theory"
  technique: "Summations"
  given: |
    Let $S_n$ be the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers.
    $ S_n = sum_(i=1)^n i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n $
  to_prove: |
    Prove that the formula for $S_n$ is $n(n+1)/2$.
  hint: |
    This is a classic proof by induction.

- id: "SHOWCASE-004"
  year: 2024
  lecturer: "Dr. Euclid"
  topic: "Linear Algebra"
  technique: "Matrix Operations"
  given: |
    Let the matrices $A$ and $B$ be defined as:
    $ A = mat(1, 2; 3, 4) quad B = mat(5, 6; 7, 8) $
  to_prove: |
    Calculate the matrix product $C = A B$.
  hint: |
    Recall that for $C = A B$, the element $c_(i j)$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A$ and the $j$-th column of $B$.
